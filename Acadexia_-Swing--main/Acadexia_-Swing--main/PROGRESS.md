## 📌 Project Overview
Acadexia is a comprehensive desktop College Management System built strictly with **Java Swing**. It provides role-based access for:
- **Principal**: Executive head handling high-level institutional approvals (Final Duty Leave sanctions, HOD appointments, Institutional analytics, Grievance oversight).
- **System Admin**: Technical administrator managing user credentials, account provisioning, database settings, and inspecting system activity & security **Audit Logs**.
- **Faculty (Composite Roles)**: Subject Faculty (all classes), Class Advisor/CFA (assigned class), and HOD (department head).
- **Students**: Academic marksheets, internal evaluations, attendance, timetable, feedback, grievances, and duty leave submissions.

> 💡 **Key Architecture & Security Notes**:  
> 1. **Unique Institutional Identifiers**:
>    - **Students**: Every student has a unique **Register Number** (e.g., `REG2024CS001`) and class **Roll Number**. Students log in directly using their **Register Number** + password.
>    - **Faculty**: Every faculty member has a unique **Faculty ID / Employee Code** (e.g., `FAC-CS-101`). Faculty log in using their **Faculty ID** + password.
>    - **Principal**: Logs in using Principal ID (`PRINCIPAL`) + password.
>    - **System Admin**: Technical administrators log in with their **Admin Username** + password.
> 2. **Principal vs. System Admin Separation of Concerns**:
>    - **Principal**: Holds the ultimate institutional authority. Academic and administrative approvals (such as final Duty Leave sanctions, approving HOD appointments, and grievance escalations) are strictly reserved for the Principal.
>    - **System Admin**: Focuses on IT administration and system governance. System Admins manage credentials, view active user sessions, monitor security alerts, and inspect **System Audit Logs** (tracking logins, SQL injection attempts blocked, record changes). They do not approve academic duty leaves.
> 3. **3-Tier Duty Leave Approval Pipeline**:
>    - **Tier 1 (Class Advisor / CFA)**: Reviews student duty leave application and proof, gives recommendation (Recommended / Not Recommended).
>    - **Tier 2 (HOD)**: Endorses application with department remarks.
>    - **Tier 3 (Principal)**: Grants the final institutional approval or rejection.
> 4. **Composite Faculty Roles**: Faculty roles are **not mutually exclusive**. A single faculty member can teach subjects across multiple classes (as a Subject Faculty), act as the designated **Class Faculty Advisor (CFA)** for a specific class batch, and simultaneously serve as the **Head of Department (HOD)**. The Faculty Dashboard dynamically enables the respective workspace tabs (Subject Teaching, Class Advisor Portal, and HOD Portal) based on the logged-in faculty member's active assignments.  
> 5. **Cross-Departmental Teaching**: HODs and faculty are **not restricted to teaching within their own department**. For example, a Mathematics HOD or Humanities faculty can be assigned to teach subjects (e.g., Discrete Mathematics, Engineering Economics) to students of Computer Science, Mechanical, etc. In their **"My Teaching"** view, faculty see all classes and subjects they teach across any department, while their **"HOD Portal"** strictly scopes administrative governance to their own department.  
> 6. **Dual-Layer SQL Injection & Exploit Prevention**:
>    - **UI Input Layer (Swing `DocumentFilter`)**: All `JTextField`, `JPasswordField`, and `JTextArea` inputs are guarded by custom `DocumentFilter`s (`SqlSanitizerFilter`, `AlphaNumericFilter`, `NumericRangeFilter`). These actively block SQL meta-characters (`;`, `--`, `/*`, `'`, `"`, `\0`), prohibit dangerous keywords, enforce strict length boundaries, and provide immediate visual cues if invalid input is typed or pasted.
>    - **DAO / Data Layer**: 100% strict enforcement of `java.sql.PreparedStatement` with parameterized placeholders (`?`). String concatenation in SQL statements is strictly banned throughout the application. Salting & hashing passwords via BCrypt.

## 📝 Change Log
- **2026-10-11**:
  - **Parent Dashboard & Guardian Portal**:
    - Architected and fully implemented the Parent Dashboard in pure Java Swing (`ParentDashboardFrame.java`), preserving 100% of the landing page dark theme aesthetic and enforcing strict read-only access to child records.
    - Updated `AdminDashboardFrame` with parent provisioning, verification management, and child re-linking tools.
    - Extended `FacultyDashboardFrame` with daily classwork logging and parent/student feedback posting.
    - Enhanced schema and seeder with `parents`, `daily_classwork`, `faculty_remarks`, `exam_schedules`, and `notifications` tables.
    - Automated verification passed 11 out of 11 integration checks with 0 compiler errors or warnings.
- **2026-10-04**: 
  - Project initialized based on handwritten flowchart.
  - Created `PROGRESS.md` covering all entities and workflows.
  - Configured tech stack preferences: Java 27, Swing FlatLaf Dark Theme, MySQL 3306, Maven.
  - **Refined Faculty Architecture**: Updated data model and UI architecture so that Faculty roles are composite, not mutually exclusive. A faculty member can simultaneously teach multiple subjects across different classes, advise a specific class (CFA), and serve as an HOD. The Faculty dashboard dynamically activates respective tabs according to active assignments.
  - **Cross-Departmental Teaching Support**: Explicitly architected `subject_assignments` and the faculty dashboard to support inter-departmental teaching (e.g., Mathematics or Basic Science HOD/faculty teaching courses to Computer Science or Mechanical batches). HOD administrative scope remains securely bounded to their home department while their teaching scope is universal.
  - **Unique Institutional Identifiers**: Integrated unique **Register Number** for Students and **Faculty ID / Employee Code** for Faculty across the database schema and authentication login portal.
  - **Strict Java Swing Mandate**: Confirmed pure native desktop implementation using Java Swing (`javax.swing.*`, `java.awt.*`) with FlatLaf Dark L&F for modern desktop styling. No web components or web wrappers.
  - **SQL Injection Prevention & Input Filtering**: Implemented dual-layer protection: (1) Custom Swing `DocumentFilter`s attached to all text inputs to filter and reject SQL injection patterns, characters, and malicious payloads at keystroke/paste time, and (2) 100% parameterized `PreparedStatement` queries at the DAO layer.
  - **Principal Role & System Admin Audit Separation**: Added dedicated **Principal** role for executive sanctions (Tier-3 final Duty Leave approvals, HOD appointments, academic analytics oversight) and separated **System Admin** into a technical management portal with dedicated **System & Security Audit Logs Viewer** (monitoring logins, user modifications, and blocked SQL injection attempts).
  - **Full Implementation Complete**: All 44 source files created across models, DAOs, security filters, database auto-initialization/seeder, and UI dashboards (Landing, Student, Faculty, Principal, and System Admin). Verified compilation with `mvn clean compile` and generated executable JAR with `mvn package`.
